// The Gameboard class encapsulates the functionality of the Tetris game board.
// It is essentially a grid of blocks, and we will implement it with a 2D array.
//
// The Gameboard class has no concept of what a tetromino is!
// This is intentional abstraction and makes the gameboard’s implementation as 
// simple as possible. The gameboard class simply manages a 2D array of content
// (integers). Each integer of content can represent either an empty spot, or a
// color.  Gameboard member functions operate on that content (particularly on
// rows) to facilitate operations that happen on a Tetris gameboard (checking for
// a complete row, filling a row, copying a row, collapsing rows, etc…).
//
// Actual gameplay is handled by a separate class (which makes use of the gameboard).
// We will handle this in a future lab. To get a sense of the bigger picture and how 
// the gameboard is used : a GridTetromino (a special Tetromino that has knowledge of
// its location on a co-ordinate system) will eventually reach a location on the 
// gameboard where it cannot move down any further (because the points that it would
// occupy already contain content).At this point, the information that a Tetromino 
// contains about its blocks (location and color) will be copied to the gameboard grid.
// We use the gameboard to determine what points are already occupied as a result of 
// previous tetrominoes being “locked”, and what the contents are.It deals strictly in
// terms of[x][y] locations, and content(color, or EMPTY_BLOCK)
// 
// Displaying the board(via text output) should show empty spots, and areas where blocks
// of color(content) have been copied("locked") onto the board from tetrominos that have
// already been placed(either intentionally or not).
//
// - The game board is represented by a 2D array of integers(the grid).
// - The array contains content(integers) which represent either :
//    - an EMPTY_BLOCK(-1),
//    - a color from the Tetromino::TetColor enum.
// - This 2D array is oriented with[0][0] at the top left and[MAX_X][MAX_Y] at the bottom
//     right. Why ? It makes it easier to draw the grid on the screen later because this 
//     is the same way things are drawn on a screen co-ordinate system(where pixel 0, 0 is
//     considered top left).
// - Note that a 2D array normally has a[row][col] orientation.Since this grid is used as
//     a co-ordinate system, an[x][y] orientation is used where x (representing of the column
//     index) comes first, and y (representing the row index) comes second. This is the
//     opposite of what you'd normally expect of a 2D array.  If you were to print out the 2D
//     array using a [row][column] orientation, you would find that it is horizontal instead
//     of vertical and you may even exceed the bounds of the arrays!  If you simply think in
//     terms of an x, y co-ordinate system, you should be fine. Use 2 for loops to initialize
//     the array. Using an initializer list would be very confusing (because of the 
//     orientation change).
